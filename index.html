            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a Manufacturing Engineer pursuing continuing education in Computer 
                Science. I love problem solving and enjoy the process of chipping away at a 
                confusing problem step by step. That's what draws me to coding and Compuer Science. 
                I find programming very engaging, whether it's debugging or thinking about how objects 
                should relate to each other. I'm looking forward to learning more!

                Outside of work and school, I spend a lot of my time rock climbing. It's tremendously fulfilling because it
                provides outdoor adventure, community, travel, and a sense of progression toward long-term goals.
                I also enjoy traveling and reading.
